    "summary": "Hi, I'm Paul, an AI and data engineering leader specializing in healthcare, life science, and insurance. With 15 years of experience, I have held roles at prominent companies such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Red Ventures, Booz Allen Hamilton, and Slalom Consulting, delivering world-class software solutions to Fortune 500 companies. I'm also a social activist on a mission to make wealth accessible to working-class entrepreneurs and their families by empowering them with free and open-source AI agents.  My superpowers include AI, Machine Learning, and Data: - Engineering Team Management — I manage technical people and projects from ideation to production. - Platform Architecture — I design and build software infrastructure on-premises and in the cloud. - Governance — I mitigate risk by protecting data and ensuring data privacy.  - Operations — I address operational inefficiencies by improving data accessibility and infrastructure reliability.  My portfolio includes the following applications: - A machine learning platform for detecting mental health disorders using audio data. - A data platform for detecting brain diseases using neuroimaging data. - A data lake and high-performance computing environment for managing and processing genomics data. - Data pipelines and multiple full-stack web applications for visualizing and predicting patient needs and healthcare facility capacity.  I most often leverage the AWS cloud for my large enterprise customers. The AWS services I most often use include Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Amazon Deep Learning AMIs.  I'm well-versed in building conversational interfaces and generative AI applications on AWS (using Amazon Nova, Lex, and Comprehend) and Microsoft Azure (using Copilot, Bot, Search, and Machine Learning). Anthropic provides my favorite, high-performing LLMs.   My current open-source AI stack includes Ollama, Open WebUI, LangChain, n8n, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, and various LLMs (including the Mistral, Qwen, Llama, and DeepSeek families of models). I'm using this stack, along with custom Cursor coding agents, to build decentralized Web 3.0 apps and AI agents that help working-class families generate wealth.  Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together here and on GitHub: https://github.com/praeducer.",

Broadly stated, there are four goals for this class: 1) Understand the principles of user-centered design and how to apply them to a software-based project 2) Understand the history of human-computer interaction and how it’s changed over time 3) Explore why “good” interface design is not necessarily “common sense” 4) Utilize skills and knowledge from other disciplines in developing a software-based project  During the semester we primarily focused on one project as described in the syllabus:  You will undertake a group project to: + evaluate some computing-related task/problem  + develop interface design alternatives for the task/problem  + implement a prototype of your design  + evaluate your design  The theme for this semester’s projects is: Connecting to (*) You.  You should think of this domain as exploring how technological innovation can help an individual become the person they want to be. Thus, the * in the domain above can be “a better”, “a wealthier”, a “healthier”, etc. By design, this is a large and rich domain to explore and we will help you investigate ideas for different problems to explore in this solution. The critical aspect of selecting a problem is that it must matter to some “real-life” people. These people can be a small group of individuals, or a large one, or any group in-between, but they will serve as your “clients” whom you must communicate with and learn from.",

We wrote and deployed a software agent on their HPCs as a file gateway, allowing them to essentially mount a file storage system with low latency access to their newly created S3 buckets. Since the amount of data they had to move at the start was not too large, they requested for us to implement a site-to-site VPN for data transfer to save costs. We used AWS Glue to transform the data into a columnar format, Parquet, as it was optimized for the type of queries they planned to execute. To save both time and money, a transformation must occur when the technician attempts to query the data.  To facilitate this, when the query is ran, a CloudWatch event is fired that causes AWS Glue to transform the VCF files into Parquet and save them into another S3 bucket in their Data Lake.  The AWS Glue Data Catalog was then updated to reflect these changes. Overall, we successfully implemented a production-ready start to their data lake and automated several tasks for their data engineers.",

      "description": "Collaborative neuroimaging research is often hindered by technological, policy, administrative, and methodological barriers, despite the abundance of available data. COINSTAC (The Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) is a platform that successfully tackles these challenges through federated analysis, allowing researchers to analyze datasets without publicly sharing their data. This paper presents a significant enhancement to the COINSTAC platform: COINSTAC Vaults (CVs). CVs are designed to further reduce barriers by hosting standardized, persistent, and highly-available datasets, while seamlessly integrating with COINSTAC's federated analysis capabilities. CVs offer a user-friendly interface for self-service analysis, streamlining collaboration, and eliminating the need for manual coordination with data owners. Importantly, CVs can also be used in conjunction with open data as well, by simply creating a CV hosting the open data one would like to include in the analysis, thus filling an important gap in the data sharing ecosystem. We demonstrate the impact of CVs through several functional and structural neuroimaging studies utilizing federated analysis showcasing their potential to improve the reproducibility of research and increase sample sizes in neuroimaging studies."

Since the amount of data they had to move at the start was not too large, they requested for us to implement a site-to-site VPN for data transfer to save costs. We used AWS Glue to transform the data into a columnar format, Parquet, as it was optimized for the type of queries they planned to execute. To save both time and money, a transformation must occur when the technician attempts to query the data. To facilitate this, when the query is ran, a CloudWatch event is fired that causes AWS Glue to transform the VCF files into Parquet and save them into another S3 bucket in their Data Lake. The AWS Glue Data Catalog was then updated to reflect these changes.

COINSTAC (The Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) is a platform that successfully tackles these challenges through federated analysis, allowing researchers to analyze datasets without publicly sharing their data. This paper presents a significant enhancement to the COINSTAC platform: COINSTAC Vaults (CVs). CVs are designed to further reduce barriers by hosting standardized, persistent, and highly-available datasets, while seamlessly integrating with COINSTAC's federated analysis capabilities. CVs offer a user-friendly interface for self-service analysis, streamlining collaboration, and eliminating the need for manual coordination with data owners. Importantly, CVs can also be used in conjunction with open data as well, by simply creating a CV hosting the open data one would like to include in the analysis, thus filling an important gap in the data sharing ecosystem. We demonstrate the impact of CVs through several functional and structural neuroimaging studies utilizing federated analysis showcasing their potential to improve the reproducibility of research and increase sample sizes in neuroimaging studies.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"papers-on-cognitive-science\",\n    \"name\": \"Papers On Cognitive Science\",\n    \"publisher\": \"University of Georgia\",\n    \"published_date\": \"2012\",\n    \"url\": \"https://uga.academia.edu/PaulPrae\",\n    \"description\": \"A series of papers I wrote in pursuit of my Bachelor of Arts in Cognitive Science with a Focused Foundation in Artificial Intelligence (http://www.ai.uga.edu/) at The University of Georgia (http://www.uga.edu/).\"\n  }\n]",
